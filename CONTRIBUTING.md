## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11+ and the following tools:

- [uv] - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- [Docker] and [Docker Compose] - For running PostgreSQL and the development environment
- [Nox] - For running test sessions

**Note:** This package requires PostgreSQL due to its use of composite types. We use Docker Compose to provide the complete development environment.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jacklinke/django-pint-field.git
$ cd django-pint-field
```

2. Start the Docker Compose services:
```console
$ docker compose up -d
```

This will start:
- Django application (port 8115)
- PostgreSQL database (port 5437)
- Redis cache (port 6390)

3. The development environment is now ready. Code changes in `src/` and `example_project/` are immediately reflected.

### Running Commands

Run commands inside the Django container:

```console
# Python shell
$ docker compose exec django uv run python manage.py shell_plus

# Django management commands
$ docker compose exec django uv run python manage.py migrate
$ docker compose exec django uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run tests
$ docker compose exec django uv run pytest -v

# Access the application
# Visit http://localhost:8115 in your browser
```

For local development without Docker (requires PostgreSQL installed):

```console
$ uv sync
$ uv run pytest
```

[docker compose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/

## How to test the project

**Important:** Tests must be run inside the Docker container where PostgreSQL is available.

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ docker compose exec django uv run pytest -vv
```

Run tests with coverage:

```console
$ docker compose exec django uv run coverage run -m pytest -vv
$ docker compose exec django uv run coverage report
```

Run nox test sessions (tests multiple Python/Django versions):

```console
$ docker compose exec django nox --session=tests
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ docker compose exec django nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session:

```console
$ docker compose exec django nox --session=tests-3.13 -- -p django-5.2
```

Unit tests are located in the `example_project/` directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- All tests must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 80%+ code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.
- Run the pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting) before submitting.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
